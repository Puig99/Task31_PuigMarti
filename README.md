## Task 

We were asked to design a page with PHP that printed the multiplication tables from 1 to 10.
The code has been written in a .php document, we used the loop "for" to write down the tables in the document.
In the loop we used two counters, one for the value of the table and another one for the value of the multiplier.

The result of every iteration was put into a row of the table, we marked the row where the counters had the same value in red, and marked in black the header of each table.

## Requirements

To see the page in the correct way we will need a web navigator,  and an Apache server since the page is written in PHP.

### PHP

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.

It requires an Apacher server in order to be played in a web navigator correctly


### Apache server

We will be getting our Apacher server from the application XAMPP, that also includes another servers, so we can continue using it in the future

XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server possible.
